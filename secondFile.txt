ava SE lets you develop and deploy OpenJDK
 Java documentation has (Record Patterns and Pattern Matching for Switch);
library enhancements to interoperate with non-Java Code 
(Foreign Function and Memory API) 
and to leverage vector instructions (Vector API) 
from OpenJDK project Panama; and the first previews for 
Project Loom (Virtual Threads and Structured Concurrency),
which will drastically reduce the effort required to write 
and maintain high-throughput, 
concurrent applications in Java.
